<p>In this code, you will find a few different HTML tags and elements that we will discuss more in Week 2.</p>
    <p style="color:chocolate;">You can do <span style="font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"> a great many things</span> with <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: deeppink;">only HTML and CSS alone</span>, such as changing the <em>color</em> of this font. And even changing the <span style="font-family: cursive; color:blueviolet;"> type of font presented!</span></p>
    <p>We can change any number of things, much like a Word Processor:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Font Type</li>
        <li>Font Weight</li>
        <li>Font Size</li>
        <li>Font Color</li>
        <li>Font Emphasis (underline, italics, etc.)</li>
        <li>Text Alignment</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Now you try! </p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20pt;"> Hello World! "Sphinx of Black Quartz, judge my vow" is a much cooler sentence to test fonts than "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."</p>
    <h1>Level 1</h1>

    <h3>Level 3</h3>
    <h4>Level 4</h4>
    <h5>Level 5</h5>
    <h6>Level 6</h6>
    This is a test paragraph to help you identify how the paragraph tag works. The paragraph tag is one of the most used tags in a webpage containing text because it provides a container so you can modify the text to look the way you want.

    When you use the paragraph tag, it automatically places a space between the first paragraph and the next. The paragraph should be used for all text that is not formatted through other tags to keep all of your content the way you want it.
