       <h2> Personal Reflection</h2>
       <p class="firstparagraph">The post-COVID environment has been very much a turning point for me, both as a prospective employee and as an individual. My shift in goals both professional and personal has been dramatic, leading to leaving an entrenched job to finish my degrees, as well as deciding that I want my writing to have more of an impact than just attempting to sell products or appeasing search engines.</p> 
       <p>While this shift in my career goals has opened up a lot of possible paths, analysis paralysis comes for us all, and to me in spades. Too many doors and too little guidance on which to go through has led to me returning to university as a non-degree seeking student. I hope that expanding my knowledge base in the fields of technical writing and web design will help to clarify and consolidate my focus and lead to a new, more satisfying career; one that allows me to utilize my professional writing skills and incorporate my technical knowledge, all the while not sacrificing my enjoyment of the more creative aspects of writing.</p> 
       <p> Beyond just career-building experience, this shift (and subsequent period of unemployment) has allowed me to embrace that creative aspect and delve into fiction writing. While I am not enough of an idealist to rely on authoring fiction as a potential employment route, I am still thrilled to be refining my craft as a writer, and have begun to produce pieces for potential publication in the future.</p> 
       <p>All in all, the future is wide open for a new professional self, as well as full of chances to practice my creative talents. While the old curse says “May you live in interesting times,” it is interesting times that are the most ripe for new experiences and new goals!</p>
