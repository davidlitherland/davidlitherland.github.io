   <h1> David A. Litherland</h1>
   <h3> About</h3>
   <p><strong>David A. Litherland</strong>strong> is a professional and creative writer from Columbia, Missouri. He has a background in copy-writing, copy-editing, and creative writing for magazines and websites. He has also worked in information technology. In his educational experience, David has earned degrees in both English and German from the University of Missouri. He has also studied a bit of technical writing to expand his knowledge base. <br />While perfectly capable of professional writing, David is expanding into writing his own fiction. He is currently looking to publish several sci-fi short stories. He enjoys reading, board games, tabletop roleplaying games, and writing about himself in the third person (he feels that it makes him sound more authorial). David volunteers with the local True/False documentary film festival. He most recently worked with the Art and Build teams. He lives with his two cats, Harry and Luna, all the while wishing he lived somewhere much more like Bilbo’s <em>Bag End</em>.</p>
